                  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>This concept was born at a hackathon which thinkspace hosted at their co-working venue in Seattle. They presented the following problem to us hackers: how would we improve the thinkspace website?</p>

                    <p>Given the time limit of three hours, there were many problems that couldn’t be addressed, particularly deeper into the site, but I chose to focus on user experience issues by making the site easier to read and understand from the start, that is: the home page. Here it is as I found it.</p>

                      <img src="img/thinkspace-original-hero-image.png" alt="screenshot of homepage with gray colors and young women" />

                    <p>The challenges I identified:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Extremely poor legibility (which means the site is certainly not accessible), with gray text on white background.</li>
                      <li>Unclear hero image - how does this photo of three young woman relate to the thinkspace business? Who are they; what are they doing? It read to me as if they are students attending class, which is quite far from what thinkspace represents.</li>
                      <li>Confusion regarding the nav bar: "space" vs. "event space" vs "virtual office" … what are all these different kinds of spaces? As a visitor, I don’t understand the nuances, or which one I need.</li>
                      <li>There are two thinkspace logos on this homepage; the one in the center, and another at the top left that is so tiny as to be almost invisible. Why have two, and why should one be nearly invisible?</li>
                    </ul>


                  <h2>The Solution</h2>

                    <img src="img/thinkspace-new-homepage.png" alt="screenshot of improved homepage showing coffee and computers on table" />
                      <p>The solutions I created:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>I chose a color palette that allowed for more contrast between the text and background, making everything easier to read, and accessible.</li>
                          <li>Additionally, the color palette is now sharper and fresher overall. Complementary blues, grays and oranges visually convey a dynamism because they’re opposites on the color wheel. This opposition creates a push-pull effect on our eyes that translates to movement - quite literally, within our eyes, but also symbolically. This dynamic color scheme is meant to appeal to their key demographic of savvy professionals who are on the move - professionally, figuratively, and literally.</li>
                          <li>I changed the hero image to one that communicates a sense of what the business is about: a shared, friendly workspace full of caffeinated energy and purpose.</li>
                          <li>I cleaned up the nav bar to combine all the mentions of “space”. I streamlined all previous mentions of "space" under the heading of “Services”, which encompasses their many offerings, from several kinds of “space” for different purposes, to business support services.</li>
                          <li>I clearly displayed the thinkspace logo at the top left.</li>
                        </ul>

                      <p>The site now makes it easy to quickly understand - directly, from clear, legible text and indirectly, from visual cues like color and well-chosen images - what thinkspace offers.</p>
