              <h1>Web Design Portfolio<br>Case Study</h1>

                  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>This concept evolved from a class exercise in HTML and CSS, in which I was provided images and design comps, and asked to convert them into a web page. Here’s my original solution, which may look familiar, possibly because so many online portfolios these days seem to feature a bright, white room with a desk, a small potted succulent, and/or a cup of coffee. Although this look is really trendy right now, I must admit that it looks nothing like my real-life desk. Since we’re among friends, I’ll confide that I don’t even drink coffee…</p>

                    <p>In my work as a fine art painter, I’ve created many portfolios over the years, and it felt almost unnatural to feature work that I knew could - and did - exist all over the world in exactly the same format. For me, it was important to personalize my portfolio, and faithfully represent myself and my work.</p>

                    <p>Something else that nibbled at the back of my mind was that, to me, the image read as unecessarily impersonal, even a bit sterile.  Some months later, I actually did reencounter this image in a stock photo library and felt vindicated for having changed it. True story!</p>

                      <h2>The Solution</h2>
                        <p>My goal was to covey a more personable and individual statement. To that end, the impossibly pristine desk had to go because, to me, it doesn’t look conducive to real work! I also wanted to go a step farther, and make the first friendly overture to website visitors, just as I often would in real life.</p>
                        <p>I responded by creating a handmade hero image. I chose the chat bubble as the main visual element because it retains a clean and simple graphic statement, yet seems personal and relatable. It also provides the conversational opener, as if I’m literally speaking with visitors, along with the introductory text (and a small unicorn joke, which I couldn’t resist).</p>
                        <p>I really believe that technology doesn’t need to feel inhuman, and I want to convey an openness and ease, in both my design and interpersonal styles.</p>
